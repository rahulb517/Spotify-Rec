# Spotify-Rec

A side project I did that uses Spotify's API to help a user curate tracks that they might like. The model takes two playlists: one full of songs the user likes and the other with songs the user does not like. The model uses features from those songs, which come from Spotify's API, to predict songs that a user will like.
